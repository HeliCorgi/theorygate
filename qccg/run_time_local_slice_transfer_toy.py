"""Time-local slice-transfer architecture toy for QCCG causal dynamics.

This repair addresses a limitation of the causal-column scan: the same spatial
triangulation was repeated on every time slice.

We build a finite graph of closed S^3 triangulations generated from the
boundary of a 4-simplex by reversible 3D Pachner 1<->4 and 2<->3 moves.
A discrete history is now a path
    S_0 -> S_1 -> ... -> S_T
in this graph; adjacent times differ by at most one local spatial Pachner move.
The transfer matrix is symmetric/Hermitian and local in discrete time.

The audit checks:
- multiple distinct spatial triangulations exist in one connected state graph;
- every graph edge is an exact one-Pachner move with an inverse;
- a Hermitian transfer/move Hamiltonian exists;
- a history can have genuinely different geometries on different time slices;
- a time-nonlocal jump across two graph steps is rejected as a negative control.

This is an architecture toy only. It does not yet construct the full 4D
simplicial slab between arbitrary neighboring slices or establish a continuum
4D phase.
